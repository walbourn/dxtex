# DirectX Texture Tool

This project is the latest version of the venerable DirectX Texture Tool (dxtex.exe) from the DirectX SDK. It has been updated to build and run without requiring the use of the legacy DirectX SDK or the DirectX End-User Runtime (a.k.a. DXSETUP.exe).

A project for Visual Studio 2019 is provided, and can be upgraded to VS 2022. Note that building this project requires the MFC Visual Studio optional component be installed `Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.ATLMFC`.
